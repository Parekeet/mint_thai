#**Mint Thai**
***

###Did you just get off work?

###Are you too tired to cook?

###Are you craving some bomb.com thai food near you?

###AAANDDD... Do you want to just pick up your food and watch NetFlix at home?

If your answer is **yes, yes, yes, YES**, then have we got the app for you!

This is a web app for a restaurant called Mint Thai. Customers will be provided with an option to sign up to Mint Thai's website, or if they choose to opt out, they can still browse through the menu. Signing in to the website allows a customer to favorite food items, as well as save and create a customized menu. Customers will be able to place to-go orders using their customized combos they have saved, or just by picking and choosing from the menu!
